# books_app
An application for saving read and visited books. We add a book with a category and author, reading start date and / or end date, opinions and points. 
We can edit and delete this data. 
A dashbord has been introduced with charts such as division into categories, read and while reading a book, division into points. 
User login and registration added.


We run the mvn clean install command in the project directory
